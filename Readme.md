# Gallery JS

A general purpose JavaScript photo gallery plugin  

## Currently in early development

The goal is to provide a gallery that will dynamically fit where placed by the user.
It will have optional control buttons either as a part of the main slider or as a seperate element elsewhere on the page.
There will also be an optional preview bar that can be placed on the page to display thumbnail images in a scrollable pane.  

## Contribute

Built using Webpack so super easy to build yourself. 
1. Pull the project down
2. `npm install`
3. `webpack` to compile the dist file
4. Add the compiled `gallery.dist.js` file to your chosen html page for testing
